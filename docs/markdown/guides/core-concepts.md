# Core Concepts

Because GeoPySpark is a binding of an existing project,
GeoTrellis, some terminology and data representations have carried over. This
section seeks to explain this jargon in addition to describing how GeoTrellis
types are represented in GeoPySpark.

Before begining, all examples in this guide need the following boilerplate
code:

```python3
import datetime
import numpy as np
import geopyspark as gps
```

## Rasters

GeoPySpark differs in how it represents rasters from other geo-spatial
Python libraries like rasterIO. In GeoPySpark, they are represented by
the `Tile` class. This class contains a numpy array (refered to as
`cells`) that represents the cells of the raster in addition to other
information regarding the data. Along with `cells`, `Tile` can also
have the `no_data_value` of the raster.

**Note**: All rasters in GeoPySpark are represented as having multiple
bands, even if the original raster just contained one.

```python3

arr = np.array([[[0, 0, 0, 0],
                 [1, 1, 1, 1],
                 [2, 2, 2, 2]]], dtype=np.int16)

# The resulting Tile will set -10 as the no_data_value for the raster
gps.Tile.from_numpy_array(numpy_array=arr, no_data_value=-10)

# The resulting Tile will have no no_data_value
gps.Tile.from_numpy_array(numpy_array=arr)
```

## Extent

Describes the area on Earth a raster represents. This area is
represented by coordinates that are in some Coordinate Reference System.
Thus, depending on the system in use, the values that outline the
`Extent` can vary. `Extent` can also be refered to as a *bounding
box*.

```python3

# Creates an Extent that has an area of 100.0
extent = gps.Extent(0.0, 0.0, 10.0, 10.0)
```

## ProjectedExtent

`ProjectedExtent` describes both the area on Earth a raster represents
in addition to its CRS. Either the EPSG code or a proj4 string can be
used to indicate the CRS of the `ProjectedExtent`.

```python3

# Using an EPSG code

gps.ProjectedExtent(extent=extent, epsg=3857)

# Using a Proj4 String

proj4 = "+proj=merc +lon_0=0 +k=1 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +a=6378137 +b=6378137 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs "
gps.ProjectedExtent(extent=extent, proj4=proj4)
```

## TemporalProjectedExtent

Similar to `ProjectedExtent`, `TemporalProjectedExtent` describes
the area on Earth the raster represents, its CRS, and the time the data
was represents. This point of time, called `instant`, is an instance
of `datetime.datetime`.

```python3

time = datetime.datetime.now()
gps.TemporalProjectedExtent(extent=extent, instant=time, epsg=3857)
```

## TileLayout

`TileLayout` represents the grid which shows how rasters are orginized and
assorted in a layer. `layoutCols` and `layoutRows` detail how many
columns and rows the grid itself has, respectively.  While `tileCols`
and `tileRows` tell how many columns and rows each individual raster has.

```python3

# Describes a layer where there are four rasters in a 2x2 grid. Each raster has 256 cols and rows.

tile_layout = gps.TileLayout(layoutCols=2, layoutRows=2, tileCols=256, tileRows=256)
```

### LayoutDefinition

`LayoutDefinition` represents both how the rasters
are orginized in a layer as well as the area covered by the grid.

```python3
layout_definition = gps.LayoutDefinition(extent=extent, tileLayout=tile_layout)
```


## Tiling Strategies

It is often the case that the exact layout of the layer is unknown.
Rather than having to go through the effort of trying to figure out the
optimal layout, there exists two different tiling strategies that will
produce a layout based on the data they are given.

### LocalLayout

`LocalLayout` is the first tiling strategy and
it produces a layout where the grid is constructed over all of the pixels
within a layer of a given tile size. The resulting layout will match the
original resolution of the cells within the rasters.

**Note**: This layout **cannot be used for creating display layers.
Rather, it is best used for layers where operations and analysis will be
performed.**

```python3

# Creates a LocalLayout where each tile within the grid will be 256x256 pixels.
gps.LocalLayout()

# Creates a LocalLayout where each tile within the grid will be 512x512 pixels.
gps.LocalLayout(tile_size=512)

# Creates a LocalLayout where each tile within the grid will be 256x512 pixels.
gps.LocalLayout(tile_cols=256, tile_rows=512)
```

### GlobalLayout

The other tiling strategy is `GlobalLayout` which makes
a layout where the grid is constructed over the global extent CRS. The
cell resolution of the resulting layer be multiplied by a power of 2 for
the CRS. Thus, using this strategy will result in either up or down sampling of the
original raster.

**Note**: This layout strategy **should be used when the resulting layer
is to be dispalyed in a TMS server.**

```python3

# Creates a GobalLayout instance with the default values
gps.GlobalLayout()

# Creates a GlobalLayout instance for a zoom of 12
gps.GlobalLayout(zoom=12)
```

You may have noticed from the above two examples that `GlobalLayout`
does not create layout for a given zoom level by default. Rather, it
determines what the zoom should be based on the size of the cells within
the rasters. If you do want to create a layout for a specific zoom
level, then the `zoom` parameter must be set.

## SpatialKey

`SpatialKey`s describe the positions of rasters within
the grid of the layout. This grid is a 2D plane where the location of a raster is
represented by a pair of coordinates, `col` and `row`, respectively.
As its name and attributes suggest, `SpatialKey` deals solely with
spatial data.

```python3

gps.SpatialKey(col=0, row=0)
```

## SpaceTimeKey

Like `SpatialKey`s, `SpaceTimeKey`s are
the position of a raster in a layout. However, the grid is a 3D plane where
a location of a raster is represented by a pair of coordinates, `col` and `row`,
as well as a z value that represents a point in time called,
`instant`. Like the `instant` in `TemporalProjectedExtent`, this
is also an instance of `datetime.datetime`. Thus, `SpaceTimeKey`s
deal with spatial-temporal data.

```python3

gps.SpaceTimeKey(col=0, row=0, instant=time)
```

## Bounds

`Bounds` is the extent of the layout grid in terms of
keys. It has both a `minKey` and a `maxKey` attributes. These can
either be a `SpatialKey` or a `SpaceTimeKey` depending on the type
of data within the layer. The `minKey` is the left, uppermost cell in
the grid and the `maxKey` is the right, bottommost cell.

```python3

# Creating a Bounds from SpatialKeys

min_spatial_key = gps.SpatialKey(0, 0)
max_spatial_key = gps.SpatialKey(10, 10)

bounds = gps.Bounds(min_spatial_key, max_spatial_key)
bounds

# Creating a Bounds from SpaceTimeKeys

min_space_time_key = gps.SpaceTimeKey(0, 0, 1.0)
max_space_time_key = gps.SpaceTimeKey(10, 10, 1.0)

gps.Bounds(min_space_time_key, max_space_time_key)
```

## Metadata

`Metadata` contains information of the values within a layer. This
data pertains to the layout, projection, and extent of the data
contained within the layer.

The below example shows how to construct `Metadata` by hand, however,
this is almost never required and `Metadata` can be produced using
easier means. For `RasterLayer`, one can call the method,
`collect_metadata` and `TiledRasterLayer` has the attribute,
`layer_metadata`.

```python3

# Creates Metadata for a layer with rasters that have a cell type of int16 with the previously defined
# bounds, crs, extent, and layout definition.
gps.Metadata(bounds=bounds,
             crs=proj4,
             cell_type=gps.CellType.INT16.value,
             extent=extent,
             layout_definition=layout_definition)
```
